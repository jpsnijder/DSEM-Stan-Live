# Dynamic Structural Equation Models in Stan - Public Repo

## statement:

!This is a work in progress, and the models are still being tested on different data sets!

Snijder, Pratz, and Schubert are writing a combined Stan/DSEM tutorial paper.
Over the summer 2023 we'll add more resources here.

The `stan` implementation of Mplus DSEM models 
correspond to Hamaker et al., 2023 book chapter in the handbook of SEMs, models 1 - 6.
A PDF of the chapter made available by the authors themself here: [PDF](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/#Introduction).

Currently, we'll make model 2 available as part of a conference presentation at MathPsych 23.

N.B., make sure to the open the Rproject file first, as all paths are relative to the location of that file.
