# Dynamic Structural Equation Models in Stan - Public Repository

## statement:

Due to many requests for these models, I have decided to upload the Stan models and some preliminary results of the Stan models for the upcoming DSEM Stan tutorial paper by Snijder, Pratz, and Schubert.
Although this is a work in progress and not peer reviewed, the Stan models have been thouroughly tested (see .htmls).
The models are those of the tutorial and hence miss some functionality (within-chain parallelization, standardized estimates, etc.).
I will add more models over time. 

The `stan` implementation of Mplus DSEM models 
correspond to Hamaker et al., 2023 book chapter in the handbook of SEMs, models 1 - 6.
A PDF of the chapter made available by the authors themself here: [PDF](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/#Introduction).

N.B., make sure to the open the Rproject file first, as all paths are relative to the location of that file.

My presentations might be of help as well and can be found here on [github](https://github.com/jpsnijder/conference-materials), look for the ESCoP, FGME, and MathPsych 2023 presentations.
