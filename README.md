# Dynamic Structural Equation Models in Stan - Public Repo

## statement:

!This is a work in progress, and the models are still being tested on different datasets!

Snijder, Pratz, and Schubert are writing a combined Stan/DSEM tutorial paper.
Over the summer we'll add more resources here.

The `stan` implementation of Mplus DSEM models, 
correspond to Hamaker et al., 2023 book chapter in the handbook of SEMs, models 1 - 6.
A PDF of the chapter made available by the author themself here: [PDF](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/#Introduction).
